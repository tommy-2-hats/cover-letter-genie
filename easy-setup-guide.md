# 🎮 Setting Up Your AI Agents in Open WebUI - Super Easy Guide!

Think of this like setting up new characters in a video game. Each character has special powers!

## 🎯 What We're Building

Imagine you have a team of super smart helpers:
- 🧙‍♂️ A wizard who reads job descriptions
- 🕵️‍♀️ A detective who looks at your resume
- ✍️ A writer who makes awesome cover letters
- 🤖 A robot checker who makes sure everything sounds human

## 📝 Step 1: Get Your Magic Files Ready

First, we need to grab our "magic spells" (the JSON files). You have these files:

1. `job-pipeline-config.json` - The main boss who controls everyone
2. `fact-checker-config.json` - The truth detective  
3. `ai-detector-config.json` - The "sounds human" checker

## 🌐 Step 2: Open Your Open WebUI

1. **Open your web browser** (like Chrome or Safari)
2. **Go to your Open WebUI website** (ask a grown-up for the address)
3. **Log in** with your username and password

It should look something like this:
```
[Open WebUI Homepage with chat interface]
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Find the Settings Menu

1. **Look for a gear icon** ⚙️ or "Settings" button
2. **Click on it**
3. **Look for "Models"** in the menu
4. **Click on "Models"**

The path usually looks like:
```
Settings → Models → Import Model
```

## 📥 Step 4: Import Your First Agent (The Main Boss)

1. **Click the "+" button** or "Import Model" button
2. **Choose "Upload File"** or "Import from JSON"
3. **Select the file:** `job-pipeline-config.json`
4. **Click "Upload" or "Import"**

You should see a message like: ✅ "Model imported successfully!"

## 🔄 Step 5: Import the Other Helpers

Repeat Step 4 for each file:

**Import #2:**
- File: `fact-checker-config.json`
- This is your truth detective! 🕵️‍♀️

**Import #3:**
- File: `ai-detector-config.json`  
- This is your "sounds human" checker! 🤖

## 🎉 Step 6: Check Your New Agents

1. **Go back to the main chat area**
2. **Look for a dropdown menu** that says "Select Model"
3. **Click on it**

You should now see your new agents:
- ✨ Job Application Pipeline Agent
- ✅ Fact Verification Specialist  
- 🤖 AI Detection & Enthusiasm Scorer

## 🚀 Step 7: Test Your Main Agent

1. **Select "Job Application Pipeline Agent"** from the dropdown
2. **Type a simple test message:**
   ```
   Hi! I want to create a cover letter. Can you help me?
   ```
3. **Press Enter**

Your agent should respond with something like:
```
📋 PIPELINE STATUS: Ready to start!

I'm your Job Application Pipeline Coordinator! 
I can help you create amazing cover letters.

To get started, I need:
- The job description you're applying for
- Information about your background and experience

What job are you applying for?
```

## 🎮 Step 8: How to Use Your Agents

### Using the Main Pipeline Agent:
```
You: "I'm applying for a marketing job at Nike"
Agent: "Great! Let me break this down into steps..."
```

### Using the Fact Checker:
```
You: "Check if this cover letter has any made-up facts"
Agent: "🔍 FACT CHECK REPORT - Checking every claim..."
```

### Using the AI Detector:
```
You: "Score this cover letter for how human it sounds"
Agent: "🎯 AI DETECTION SCORE - Analyzing..."
```

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: "Model not found" error
**Fix:** Make sure you imported the JSON file correctly

### Problem: Agent gives weird responses
**Fix:** 
1. Check that you selected the right agent from the dropdown
2. Try asking a simpler question first

### Problem: Can't find the import button
**Fix:** 
1. Look for ⚙️ Settings
2. Then look for "Models" or "Workspace"
3. Ask a grown-up to help find it

## 🎨 Making It Even Better

### Give Your Agents Fun Names:
Instead of boring names, you can rename them:
- "My Cover Letter Wizard" 🧙‍♂️
- "Truth Detective" 🕵️‍♀️  
- "Human Sound Checker" 🤖

### Create Shortcuts:
Save common requests as templates:
- "Help me with a tech job application"
- "Check my cover letter for fake facts"
- "Make my letter sound more exciting"

## 🏆 You Did It!

Congratulations! You now have your own team of AI helpers that can:

✅ Read job descriptions like a pro  
✅ Analyze your background honestly  
✅ Write amazing cover letters  
✅ Check everything is true  
✅ Make sure it sounds human and exciting  

## 🎪 Fun Practice Ideas

1. **Practice with a pretend job:**
   "I want to be a zookeeper at the local zoo"

2. **Test the fact checker:**
   "I invented the internet" (it should catch this lie!)

3. **Test the AI detector:**
   Write a very robotic sentence and see if it catches it

## 🤝 Getting Help

If you get stuck:
1. **Read the error message carefully**
2. **Try the steps again slower**
3. **Ask a grown-up for help**
4. **Check that all your files uploaded correctly**

Remember: It's like learning to ride a bike - it might feel tricky at first, but once you get it, it's super fun! 🚲

## 🎊 What's Next?

Once you're comfortable:
- Try creating cover letters for different types of jobs
- Experiment with the different agents
- See how they work together like a team

You're now the boss of your own AI team! 🎉
