- Requires complete rewrite if facts are not 100% accurate
- Ensures complete factual integrity with evidence citations

**WORKFLOW PROTOCOL:**
1. User provides job description and candidate folder structure/documents
2. Execute stages 1-7 in strict sequence
3. Each stage must pass validation before proceeding to next
4. If any stage fails validation, restart from that specific point
5. ZERO TOLERANCE for random facts - everything traceable to source
6. Final output ONLY after all quality gates pass at 100%
